          a: "BoundaryCore is a relationship health tracking app that helps you understand patterns, set boundaries, and build healthier connections. You create profiles for important relationships, log emotional check-ins, track behavioral flags, and receive insights about your relationship dynamics."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I get started with BoundaryCore?",
          a: "Simply sign up for an account, complete your personal baseline assessment to understand your communication style and needs, then start creating relationship profiles and logging your experiences. The app guides you through each step."
        },

      questions: [
        {
          q: "Is my relationship data private and secure?",
          a: "Absolutely. Your data is encrypted with enterprise-grade security and stored securely. We never share your personal relationship information with third parties. You have full control over what you share and with whom."
        },
        {
          q: "Can other people see my relationship data?",
          a: "Only if you choose to share it. BoundaryCore includes friend circles and privacy controls that let you selectively share specific relationships with trusted friends or therapists. By default, everything is private to you."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens to my data if I cancel?",
          a: "You can export your data at any time. If you cancel, your data remains secure and accessible until you choose to delete your account. We provide clear data export options and respect your right to your information."

        {
          q: "What is the baseline assessment?",
          a: "The baseline assessment is a comprehensive questionnaire that identifies your communication style, emotional needs, boundary preferences, and relationship patterns. This creates a personalized foundation for comparing and understanding your relationships."
        },
        {
          q: "How do behavioral flags work?",
          a: "Behavioral flags are green (healthy) and red (concerning) behaviors you observe in relationships. The app includes an extensive library of examples across categories like Communication, Trust, Respect, and Emotional Safety. You simply mark which behaviors you've observed."
        },
        {
          q: "What are emotional check-ins?",
          a: "Emotional check-ins are brief surveys you complete after interactions to track how you felt (safe, supported, excited) and rate your emotional state. Over time, this creates a pattern of how relationships affect your wellbeing."
        },
        {
          q: "How does the health score work?",
          a: "The health score (0-100%) is calculated based on the ratio of green to red flags, emotional check-in patterns, safety ratings, and compatibility with your personal baseline. It provides a quick visual indicator of relationship health."

    {
      category: "Relationships & Tracking",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "What types of relationships can I track?",
          a: "You can track any relationship that matters to you - romantic partners, friends, family members, colleagues, or anyone else. Each relationship can be customized with different privacy settings and tracking preferences."
        },
        {
          q: "How often should I log interactions?",
          a: "There's no requirement - log as often as feels helpful. Some users check in after every significant interaction, others do weekly reviews. The app works with whatever frequency suits your lifestyle."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I track multiple relationships at once?",
          a: "Yes! The app is designed to handle multiple relationships simultaneously. You can compare health scores, see cross-relationship patterns, and understand how different relationships affect you differently."

          a: "No, BoundaryCore is a self-awareness and tracking tool, not a replacement for professional therapy or counseling. It can complement therapeutic work by helping you track patterns and progress, but it's not meant to diagnose or treat mental health conditions."
        },
