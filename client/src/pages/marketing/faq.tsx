  {
    question: "What is BoundaryCore?",
    answer: "BoundaryCore is a relationship health tracking application that helps you understand how your relationships impact your emotional well-being. Through a personal baseline assessment and detailed interaction tracking, you can identify patterns and make informed decisions about your relationships."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the baseline assessment work?",
    answer: "The baseline assessment is a comprehensive quiz covering your communication style, emotional needs, boundary requirements, and core values. This creates a personalized foundation that the app uses to analyze all your relationships and provide compatibility insights."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of data do I track?",
    answer: "You can track energy levels, anxiety, self-worth, physical symptoms, and emotional states before and after interactions. The app also tracks interaction types, duration, boundary events, and recovery patterns to provide comprehensive relationship analytics."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data private and secure?",
    answer: "Absolutely. All your relationship data is completely private and encrypted. We never share personal information with third parties, and you have full control over your data. Your privacy and emotional safety are our top priorities."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track multiple relationships?",
    answer: "Yes, you can track unlimited relationships of any type - romantic, friendships, family, colleagues, etc. The app provides cross-relationship analytics to help you understand which connections are most beneficial for your well-being."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see patterns?",
    answer: "You'll start seeing basic insights after just a few interactions, but meaningful patterns typically emerge after 1-2 weeks of consistent tracking. The more data you provide, the more accurate and helpful the insights become."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to track every interaction?",
    answer: "No, you only track interactions when you want to. Many users focus on tracking interactions that feel significant or when they notice emotional changes. The app is designed to be helpful without being overwhelming."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm in an abusive relationship?",
    answer: "BoundaryCore can help you document patterns and recognize red flags, but it's not a substitute for professional help. If you're in an abusive situation, please reach out to local domestic violence resources or call the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export my data?",
    answer: "Yes, you can export all your data at any time. This includes your baseline assessment, relationship profiles, interaction logs, and analytics. Your data belongs to you, and you should have full access to it."
  },
  {
    question: "Is BoundaryCore a replacement for therapy?",
    answer: "No, BoundaryCore is a self-help tool that complements but doesn't replace professional therapy or counseling. The insights can be valuable to discuss with a therapist, but they shouldn't be considered professional mental health advice."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes BoundaryCore different from other apps?",
    answer: "BoundaryCore focuses specifically on relationship patterns and their impact on your well-being. Unlike general mood trackers, it provides detailed analysis of how specific people and interactions affect your emotional and physical health over time."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this for work relationships?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many users track relationships with colleagues, managers, and clients to understand workplace dynamics and their impact on stress and job satisfaction. The insights can help with boundary setting and professional development."
