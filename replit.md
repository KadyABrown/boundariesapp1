# BoundarySpace - Relationship Boundary Tracker

## Overview

BoundarySpace is a comprehensive relationship health tracking application that automatically analyzes relationship patterns through detailed interaction tracking and personal baseline assessment. The core function is to help users understand how their relationships impact their physical health, emotional well-being, and personal boundaries by comparing real interaction data against their established personal needs and values.

**Core App Function:**
1. **Personal Baseline Assessment** - Users define their communication style, emotional needs, boundary requirements, and core values
2. **Comprehensive Interaction Tracking (CIT)** - Detailed logging of relationship interactions with pre/post measurements of energy, anxiety, self-worth, and physical symptoms
3. **Automatic Pattern Recognition** - The app analyzes CIT data against the baseline to automatically identify concerning patterns and positive behaviors
4. **Intelligent Health Scoring** - Combines interaction data, baseline compatibility, and pattern analysis for meaningful relationship health scores
5. **Actionable Insights** - Shows how relationships affect physical health, self-esteem, and boundary respect with specific recommendations based on personal baseline

The system is built as a modern React SPA with an Express.js backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence and Replit's authentication system for user management.

## Friend Circle Privacy System

The app implements a tiered privacy system using friend circles to control relationship data sharing:

### Friend Circle Types & Access Levels:
1. **Close Friends**: Full access to all relationship data
2. **Dating Circle**: Access to dating-related relationships only
3. **Work Friends**: Access to public relationships only  
4. **No Circle**: No access to relationship data

### How It Works:
- Each friend can be assigned to one friend circle via the settings gear icon
- Relationship profiles have privacy settings that specify which circles can view them
- When friends view the "Shared Data" tab, they only see relationships they have permission to access
- Privacy controls are managed individually per relationship profile

### Implementation:
- Friend circles are stored in the `friendCircles` table
- Friendships have a `circleTag` field linking them to circles
- Relationship profiles have sharing settings that correspond to circle permissions
- Backend filters shared data based on friend circle membership
