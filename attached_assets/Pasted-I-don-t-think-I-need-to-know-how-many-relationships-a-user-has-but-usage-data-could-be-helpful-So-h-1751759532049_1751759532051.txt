I don’t think I need to know how many relationships a user has but usage data could be helpful. So here are some other helpful features for the admin dash:



User Profile Drill-Down
Click on a user’s name to view:
* Signup date
* Subscription history
* Activity logs (e.g. last login, key actions)
* App usage breakdown (pages/modules used most)
* Manual override (e.g. pause access, reset password, extend trial)
* Account type (Regular vs. Therapist/Coach)

Admin Role Management
* Grant/restrict access to other admins (e.g. support vs marketing roles)
* Activity logs: which admin made what changes


Feature Usage Heatmap
* Track usage frequency of key features/modules
* Visual heatmap or table: “Which features are used most?”
* Helps you improve UX, prioritize dev, and sunset dead weight.
Example: If 80% use the Emotional Clarity Log but only 12% use the Trigger Tracker, that’s actionable.


Churn Dashboard
* List of recently canceled users with reasons (if you collect them)
* Monthly churn rate %
* Average subscription length
* High-risk churn predictors (e.g. no activity for X days)


Support Ticket Integration / Flags
* See if a user has opened a support ticket (via integration with HelpScout, Zendesk, etc.)
* Add internal notes or flags to specific users ("reported bug", "requested refund", etc.
 Conversion Funnel Tracking
* Track user flow from signup → onboarding → activation → subscription
* Drop-off points = improvement opportunities  Or some kind of integration that allows me to use Google Analytics or some other 3rd party tracking tool to understand user behavior

A/B Test Controls
If you ever want to experiment:
* Assign users to test groups (early access, different onboarding flow)
* Compare activation or retention rates by cohort
 System Health + Logs
* Basic error tracking (you can integrate with Sentry or similar)
* Server uptime (via your host or custom ping)
* Performance stats (page load times, API failures, etc.)  
Founder Dashboard Metrics
If you're managing this as a solopreneur/founder:
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
* Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) (if you're running paid ads)
* Referral Sources (e.g. organic, social, email campaigns)
