The Dating Behavior Checklist is structured like a behavior-based relationship log that includes:

Partner Identity Info: Name, nickname, type of relationship, how/when you met

Feelings Tracking: Questions like "Did I feel safe and excited in the beginning?" and "Do I feel supported?"

Emotional Change Over Time: “Has it always been that way or has it changed?”

Relationship Type Tagging: Labels like “Dating Only”

Binary Scoring: Emotional and behavioral flags scored across a grid (e.g., W+, W-, X+, X-, Y-, etc.), potentially reflecting green/red flags or trait alignment

Allow for follow-up journal entries to expand on answers.

Behavioral Flag Scoring

Each flag has a tooltip/definition to guide the user.
