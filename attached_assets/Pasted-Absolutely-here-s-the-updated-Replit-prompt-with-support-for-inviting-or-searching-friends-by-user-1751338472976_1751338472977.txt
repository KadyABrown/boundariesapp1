Absolutely — here’s the updated Replit prompt with support for inviting or searching friends by username, email, or phone number, along with the necessary update to the user profile/account system.

🔧 Replit Prompt: Friend System + Search by Phone Number + Visibility Controls

I’d like to add a Friend System to the app that allows users to:

⸻

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 1. Core Friend Functionality
	•	Send/Accept Friend Requests
	•	Users can search for other users by:
	•	Username
	•	Email
	•	Phone number
	•	Users can send friend requests
	•	Recipient can accept or decline
	•	Friendship is mutual (two-way)
	•	Manage Friends List
	•	View list of accepted friends
	•	View incoming and outgoing requests
	•	Unfriend or block users

⸻

🗂️ 2. Circles / Friend Groups
	•	Users can optionally organize friends into custom circles or tags (e.g., “Therapist”, “Trusted”, “School Friends”)
	•	Circles are private to the user

⸻

🔐 3. Relationship Visibility Integration
	•	When creating/editing a relationship, the user should be able to select visibility options:
	•	Private (only me)
	•	All Friends
	•	Selected Friends or Circles (multi-select)
	•	Therapist/Guardian only
	•	Each visibility level defines what a friend can see:
	•	Relationship name + status only
	•	Flag summary only
	•	Full details

⸻

🔕 4. Silent Exit Notification Feature
	•	When a user marks a relationship as “Over,” and it was shared with friends:
	•	Option to silently notify selected friends (“[Name] has removed this relationship from their profile.”)

⸻

📱 5. User Profile Update (Phone Number Support)

Update the user profile system to store a phone number field (optional but unique):
	•	Validate for proper format
	•	Store as phone_number in Supabase
	•	Allow users to be found or invited via phone number

⸻

🛠️ Notes
	•	Use Supabase for database logic
	•	Add appropriate indexes for friend search (username, email, phone)
	•	Each friendship record should include:
	•	requester_id
	•	receiver_id
	•	status (requested, accepted, blocked)
	•	created_at
	•	optional circle or tag

Use React (or current front-end framework) to:
	•	Render add/search friend UI with all 3 options
	•	Show visibility settings in relationship form
	•	Enable multi-select sharing with friend circles

⸻

Let me know if you also want to include a “Pending Invite via Phone” state (for when someone hasn’t signed up yet), or if you’re ready to build the sharing engine logic next.
